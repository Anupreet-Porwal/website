# Biography

I am a PhD student in the {{% staticref "https://www.stat.washington.edu/" "newtab" %}}Department of Statistics{{% /staticref %}} at the University of Washington. I am broadly interested in Bayesian Machine Learning and Statistical Modelling Techniques. Before coming to UW, I worked as an analyst with North American Liability Strategies team in {{% staticref "https://deutschebank.co.in/" "newtab" %}}Deutsche Bank (DB){{% /staticref %}}. At DB, I advised North American corporate clients on their liability strategies including liability management, capital structure analysis, ratings and pension advisory. 

I did my bachelors and masters in Mathematics and Scientific Computing from Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur in 2017 where I was fortunate to work with  {{% staticref "http://home.iitk.ac.in/~kundu/kundu.html" "newtab" %}}Prof. Debasis Kundu{{% /staticref %}}, {{% staticref "http://home.iitk.ac.in/~amitra/" "newtab" %}}Prof. Amit Mitra{{% /staticref %}} and  {{% staticref "https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/piyush/" "newtab" %}}Prof. Piyush Rai{{% /staticref %}}. During my stay at IIT Kanpur, I have developed a strong skill set in areas of Bayesian Machine Learning and Statistical Modelling Techniques and their applications to everyday life.
