# Biography

I am Anupreet Porwal, currently working as an analyst with North American Liability Strategies team in Deutsche Bank (DB). At DB, I advise North American corporate clients on their liability strategies including liability management, capital structure analysis, ratings and pension advisory. 

Previously, I majored in Mathematics and Scientific Computing from Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur in 2017 where I was fortunate to work with  {{% staticref "http://home.iitk.ac.in/~kundu/kundu.html" "newtab" %}}Prof. Debasis Kundu{{% /staticref %}}, {{% staticref "http://home.iitk.ac.in/~amitra/" "newtab" %}}Prof. Amit Mitra{{% /staticref %}} and  {{% staticref "https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/piyush/" "newtab" %}}Prof. Piyush Rai{{% /staticref %}} During my stay at IIT Kanpur, I have developed a strong skill set in areas of Bayesian Machine Learning and Statistical Modelling Techniques and their applications to everyday life. Following my interests, I wish to pursue a Ph.D. in Statistics.
