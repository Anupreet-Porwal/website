abstract = "In this paper, we consider the problem of estimating the model order of a complex superimposed exponential signal model in presence of additive white noise. We use the recently proposed Exponentially Embedded Family (EEF) rule based order estimation technique and study its large sample asymptotic statistical properties. We prove that the EEF rule based estimator is consistent in large sample scenario. We further compare the finite sample performance of EEF rule based estimator for order estimation with other popular order estimation rules using simulation examples."
